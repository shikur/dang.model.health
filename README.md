 Sample requirements.txt
For your requirements.txt, you would list the dependencies required for your project. Here's an example that includes spaCy, LangChain, LambIndex, and MLflow:

spacy==3.2.1
langchain=0.1.12  # Adjust to the latest version available
LlamaIndex=0.10.19   # Placeholder version, please check the correct one for LambIndex
mlflow==1.23.1
openai
ib_insync
pandas
llama-index
jinja2
streamlit

pip install llama-index

Getting Started
Here are the steps to get started with your project:

Environment Setup: Create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies. You can use virtualenv or conda for this:


python -m venv your_project_venv
source your_project_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `your_project_venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies: Install the required libraries using pip and your requirements.txt file:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Initial Setup:

spaCy: You may need to download a language model for spaCy. For example, to download the English model:


python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
MLflow: Start the MLflow tracking server if you're using it for experiment tracking:

mlflow ui
